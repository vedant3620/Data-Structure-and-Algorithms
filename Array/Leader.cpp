/*
Leaders in an array
Given an array of positive integers. Your task is to find the leaders in the array.
Note: An element of array is leader if it is greater than or equal to all the elements to its right side. Also, the rightmost element is always a leader. 

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of array.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.

Output:
Print all the leaders.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 107
0 <= Ai <= 107

Example:
Input:
3
6
16 17 4 3 5 2
5
1 2 3 4 0
5
7 4 5 7 3
Output:
17 5 2
4 0
7 7 3

Explanation:
Testcase 3: All elements on the right of 7 (at index 0) are smaller than or equal to 7. Also, all the elements of right side of 7 (at index 3) are smaller than 7. And, the last element 3 is itself a leader since no elements are on its right.
